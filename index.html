                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this activity, we analyzed poverty through the lens of deprivation theory. We examined real cases of families lacking basic needs, using Pastoral San Pedro as an example. We studied a family of eight living in one house with an income of only $40 per week.</p>

                <h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    By creating and improving the "Poverty as Deprivation" product, my understanding of poverty in Ecuador underwent a profound transformation. I learned that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that transcends the simple lack of economic income. Through rigorous analysis of deprivation theory and, specifically, the case study of the family in Pastoral San Pedro—eight people surviving on $40 a week—I understood that poverty is the systemic and forced inability to satisfy fundamental human needs. It is not just about not having money; it is about not having privacy, not having adequate nutrition, lacking a safe roof, and living with the constant uncertainty of survival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This learning was deeply meaningful to me because it managed to connect abstract academic theory with the raw and tangible reality I observed during my service hours at "Semillas de Esperanza". Before this course, I admit I could view poverty as a distant statistic or a problem of "others". However, by understanding the technical concept of deprivation, I was able to see the structural deficiencies behind the faces of the children and families I worked with. I understood that these families do not "choose" to live this way due to a lack of desire to work, but rather are trapped in intergenerational cycles of deprivation of basic rights that the system does not guarantee them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a personal level, this learning challenged my previous beliefs about meritocracy. I realized that individual effort, while necessary, is not always sufficient when social structures deprive people of the most elementary tools. In Ecuador, many people live below the average and must sacrifice basic needs—such as their children's education or their own health—simply to subsist one more day. It was a reality check to understand that my position is privileged not only by what I have but by the opportunities I can access without barriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, this has radically changed my perspective on my future role. I understood that I cannot practice my profession in a bubble isolated from society; I must be aware of the inequalities that surround me. As a future professional, I have an ethical responsibility not only to seek economic or technical success but to use my skills to mitigate these deprivations in my environment. Whether designing more inclusive projects, advocating for fair policies, or simply being an empathetic leader, I understood that true professional progress must be inclusive and leave no one behind. Technical excellence without social conscience is empty.

                        "Responsible citizenship is an active, empathetic, and constant commitment to collective well-being. It is no longer just about obeying laws, but about living solidarity daily. It is having the capacity to feel others' pain as one's own and acting to transform that reality, understanding that my individual actions directly impact the quality of life of my local and global community."

                <h3>Comparison and Evolution</h3>
                <p>
                    Comparing my initial definition of citizenship with my current perspective, it is evident that a fundamental transition has occurred in my civic consciousness: I have moved from a theoretical, legalistic, and passive vision to a practical, human, and proactive one. In my previous definition, I limited citizenship almost exclusively to the fulfillment of formal and bureaucratic civic duties, such as voting every four years, paying taxes, and not breaking traffic laws. I saw the "good citizen" as someone who simply causes no trouble, a passive entity who complies with the bare minimum from an individualistic and safe position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, after my service experience at "Semillas de Esperanza", my definition has changed drastically. What remains the same is the respect for rules and the rule of law, as I understand they are the basis of coexistence. But what has radically changed is the motivation and the depth of the commitment. I now understand that citizenship is not exercised only at the ballot box, but in daily dealings with others, especially the most vulnerable. The class theory came to life when I had to interact with the children and their realities, forcing me to see that citizenship is a daily exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most significant change lies in the incorporation of the concept of "active empathy". Before, my citizenship was distant and cold; now, it requires me to get involved emotionally and physically. I have learned that being a citizen means practicing solidarity not as an occasional or vertical act of charity, but as a constant responsibility of mutual and horizontal support. Living social service taught me that responsible citizenship implies stepping out of my comfort zone to understand the struggles of others and using my privileges and capabilities to serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This evolution is because direct contact with the community broke down my prejudices. I realized that my inaction also has consequences. I no longer see citizenship as a legal status I possess, but as a tool for social transformation that I must use. Empathy is now the main engine driving my collective action towards a fairer Ecuador, where my well-being is intrinsically linked to the well-being of my neighbor.

                    <h4>Empathy</h4>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
                    <p>It is fundamental to civic engagement because it allows us to understand the needs and contexts of others without judgment, creating genuine bridges of human connection. Without empathy, service becomes mechanical.</p>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Did you apply it? How?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, I applied it constantly. A clear situation was when I had to put myself in the shoes of the center's educators. At first, it might have seemed their job was simple, but observing their load, I understood the stress and responsibility they carry. This empathy allowed me to value their work and adjust my attitude to be a real support rather than another burden for them, listening to their needs before acting.</p>

                    <h4>Solidarity</h4>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
                    <p>Solidarity transforms society by making us understand that we are not islands; the well-being of the other is my responsibility too. It is the value that mobilizes mutual aid and breaks individualism.</p>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Did you apply it? How?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, I applied it beyond my assigned duty. Although I had a specific educator assigned, I realized I was not alone in the world nor in the center. When I saw other educators overwhelmed with the children, I approached to help them proactively without being asked. I understood that the goal was the well-being of all children, not just fulfilling my schedule, practicing active and selfless solidarity.</p>

                    <h4>Patience</h4>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
                    <p>In civic service, results are not immediate and working with vulnerable people requires tolerance and calm to build trust and respect. Impatience can destroy bonds.</p>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Did you apply it? How?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, it was crucial working with children aged 1 to 3. A clear example was mealtime; many children didn't want to eat or threw tantrums. Instead of getting frustrated or reacting poorly, I learned to breathe and accompany them patiently, trying again and again until they ate. I understood that their behavior is part of their development and they need emotional containment, not scolding or rushing.</p>
