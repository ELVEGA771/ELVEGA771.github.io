                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this activity, we analyzed poverty through the lens of deprivation theory. We examined real cases of families lacking basic needs, using Pastoral San Pedro as an example. We studied a family of eight living in one house with an income of only $40 per week.</p>

                <h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
                <div class="reflection-content">
                    <p>By creating and improving the "Poverty as Deprivation" product, my understanding of poverty in Ecuador underwent a profound transformation. I learned that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that transcends the simple lack of economic income. Through rigorous analysis of deprivation theory and, specifically, the case study of the family in Pastoral San Pedro—eight people surviving on $40 a week—I understood that poverty is the systemic and forced inability to satisfy fundamental human needs.</p>
                    <p>This learning was deeply meaningful to me because it managed to connect abstract academic theory with the raw and tangible reality I observed during my service hours at "Semillas de Esperanza". Before this course, I admit I could view poverty as a distant statistic or a problem of "others". However, by understanding the technical concept of deprivation, I was able to see the structural deficiencies behind the faces of the children and families I worked with.</p>
                    <p>On a personal level, this learning challenged my previous beliefs about meritocracy. I realized that individual effort, while necessary, is not always sufficient when social structures deprive people of the most elementary tools. In Ecuador, many people live below the average and must sacrifice basic needs—such as their children's education or their own health—simply to subsist one more day.</p>
                    <p>Professionally, this has radically changed my perspective on my future role. I understood that I cannot practice my profession in a bubble isolated from society; I must be aware of the inequalities that surround me. As a future professional, I have an ethical responsibility not only to seek economic or technical success but to use my skills to mitigate these deprivations in my environment. Technical excellence without social conscience is empty.</p>

                            "Before, I mainly associated responsible citizenship with basic actions such as voting in elections, paying taxes, and obeying the law. I thought that being a good citizen simply meant not causing trouble, staying informed about national news, and occasionally participating in volunteer activities. My perspective was more reactive than proactive."

                            "Responsible citizenship is an active, empathetic, and constant commitment to collective well-being. It is no longer just about obeying laws, but about living solidarity daily. It is having the capacity to feel others' pain as one's own and acting to transform that reality, understanding that my individual actions directly impact the quality of life of my local and global community."

                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-dots"></i> Comparison and Evolution</h3>
                <p>Comparing my initial definition of citizenship with my current perspective, it is evident that a fundamental transition has occurred in my civic consciousness: I have moved from a theoretical, legalistic, and passive vision to a practical, human, and proactive one.</p>
                <p>What has radically changed is the motivation and the depth of the commitment. I now understand that citizenship is not exercised only at the ballot box, but in daily dealings with others, especially the most vulnerable. The class theory came to life when I had to interact with the children and their realities, forcing me to see that citizenship is a daily exercise.</p>
                <p>The most significant change lies in the incorporation of the concept of "active empathy". Before, my citizenship was distant and cold; now, it requires me to get involved emotionally and physically. Living social service taught me that responsible citizenship implies stepping out of my comfort zone to understand the struggles of others and using my privileges and capabilities to serve.</p>
                <p>Direct contact with the community broke down my prejudices. I realized that my inaction also has consequences. I no longer see citizenship as a legal status I possess, but as a tool for social transformation that I must use. Empathy is now the main engine driving my collective action.</p>

                    <h4>Empathy</h4>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
                    <p>It is fundamental to civic engagement because it allows us to understand the needs and contexts of others without judgment, creating genuine bridges of human connection. Without empathy, service becomes mechanical.</p>
                    <div class="application-box">
                        <p class="question"><strong>Did you apply it? How?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, I applied it constantly. A clear situation was when I had to put myself in the shoes of the center's educators. At first, it might have seemed their job was simple, but observing their load, I understood the stress and responsibility they carry. This empathy allowed me to value their work and adjust my attitude to be a real support rather than another burden for them, listening to their needs before acting.</p>

                    <h4>Solidarity</h4>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
                    <p>Solidarity transforms society by making us understand that we are not islands; the well-being of the other is my responsibility too. It is the value that mobilizes mutual aid and breaks individualism.</p>
                    <div class="application-box">
                        <p class="question"><strong>Did you apply it? How?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, I applied it beyond my assigned duty. Although I had a specific educator assigned, I realized I was not alone in the world nor in the center. When I saw other educators overwhelmed with the children, I approached to help them proactively without being asked. I understood that the goal was the well-being of all children, not just fulfilling my schedule, practicing active and selfless solidarity.</p>

                    <h4>Patience</h4>
                    <p class="question"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
                    <p>In civic service, results are not immediate and working with vulnerable people requires tolerance and calm to build trust and respect. Impatience can destroy bonds.</p>
                    <div class="application-box">
                        <p class="question"><strong>Did you apply it? How?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, it was crucial working with children aged 1 to 3. A clear example was mealtime; many children didn't want to eat or threw tantrums. Instead of getting frustrated or reacting poorly, I learned to breathe and accompany them patiently, trying again and again until they ate. I understood that their behavior is part of their development and they need emotional containment, not scolding or rushing.</p>
